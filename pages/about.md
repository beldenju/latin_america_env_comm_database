## About the project

"Environmental Discourses in Latin America" ​​is a project created to highlight research produced in and about the region, with a focus on environmental communication. It also seeks to foster dialogue and collaboration between researchers from the Global South and the Global North.

This initiative, led by Dr. Bruno Takahashi of Michigan State University, includes a variety of activities, including a symposium and workshop that will bring together Latin American researchers at Michigan State University from March 31 to April 2, 2025. It will also feature a database compiling work published by regional researchers on environmental communication.

This project stems from the recognition that Latin American scholars contribute essential perspectives to the study of environmental communication and from the need to overcome the barriers that perpetuate forms of bibliometric coloniality.
