## About the project

This database highlights environmental communication research produced in and about Latin America. It also seeks to foster dialogue and collaboration between researchers from the Global South and the Global North.

Led by Dr. Bruno Takahashi of Michigan State University, this initiative stems from the recognition that Latin American scholars contribute essential perspectives to the study of environmental communication and from the need to overcome the barriers that perpetuate forms of bibliometric coloniality.
